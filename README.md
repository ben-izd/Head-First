Inspiring from Oâ€™Reilly's "Head First" series, this repository contains illustrations of various packages/libraries from different languages.

Feel free to used them in your article, books or videos. You can even access to vector file accompnay those images. Mentioning me or this repository is not mandatory but is much appreciated.

I would welcome any suggestion about the images, codes and other files or new ideas to explore.
